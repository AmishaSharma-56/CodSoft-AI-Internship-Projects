# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax

This is a command-line **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built in Python that lets you play against an **unbeatable AI**. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**, ensuring optimal performance and strategy every time.

---

### ⚙️ Features

- Play as `X` or `O`  
- Choose to move first or let the AI start  
- AI calculates the best move using Minimax  
- Detects wins, draws, and invalid inputs  
- Replay option with fresh game board  
- Displays time taken for AI to compute moves  

---

### 🧠 Tech Highlights

- **Minimax Algorithm:** Decision-making for perfect play  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Efficient evaluation by cutting unnecessary branches  
- **Python Standard Library:** No external dependencies  
- **Clean CLI-based UX** with intuitive instructions and symbols  

---

### 💻 How to Run

```bash
python tic_tac_toe_ai.py
```

You'll be prompted to:
- Choose your symbol: `X` or `O`
- Decide who goes first
- Enter moves in the format: `row col` (e.g. `0 2`)
