# CodSoft-AI-Internship-Projects
Welcome to my repository for the CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship. This internship involved exploring key areas of AI by completing hands-on projects that demonstrate both foundational and advanced concepts. Below are the tasks I tackled, each designed to deepen my understanding of AI development, algorithms, and practical applications.
# Internship Tasks Overview
Note: A minimum of **three tasks** must be completed for successful internship certification.
# Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot
**Objective:** Build a simple chatbot that uses predefined rules to interact with users.

**Techniques Used:**
- If-else logic or pattern matching
- Basic conversation flow handling

**Learning Outcome:** Introduces fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and helps understand how rule-based systems simulate human conversation.
# Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
**Objective:** Create an AI agent that plays the classic game against a human player.

**Techniques Used:**
- Minimax Algorith
- Alpha-Beta Pruning (optional)
- 
**Learning Outcome:** Explores game theory and search algorithms, enabling you to build an unbeatable AI game player.
# Task 3: Image Captioning
**Objective:** Combine computer vision and NLP to generate captions for images.

**Techniques Used:**
- Pre-trained CNN models like VGG or ResNet for feature extraction
- RNN or Transformer-based models for caption generation

**Learning Outcome:** Highlights the synergy between vision and language models, a core concept in multimodal AI systems.
# Task 4: Recommendation System
**Objective:** Build a system that suggests items based on user preferences.

**Techniques Used:**
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-Based Filtering

**Learning Outcome:** Provides insights into personalization algorithms widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.
# Task 5: Face Detection & Recognition
**Objective:** Develop an app that detects and recognizes human faces in images or video.

**Techniques Used:**
- Haar Cascade or deep learning-based detection models
- Face recognition with Siamese Networks or ArcFace

**Learning Outcome:** Delivers a hands-on experience with computer vision and biometric identification, crucial for security systems and smart applications.
